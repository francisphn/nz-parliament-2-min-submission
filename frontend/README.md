# The Frontend

## Customising the frontend
The best way to understand all the code in here is just to run it first. In this project directory, run `npm install` then `npm start` and play around with it. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

It starts with Step 1, with the user providing their contact information as well as their local government council.

Step 2 is where the user can preview the submission that you have pre-written for them. This is also where they can preview their contact details as well as agree with the relevant policies of Parliament before the submission is sent.

After you're done with customisation, run `npm run build` to build a production version of this frontend. This will create a directory, `build` which you could start using.

## The user interface
This frontend uses components from [MUI](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/overview/). Have a look at the documentation to get started on using the relevant components.



## React
This frontend was created using Create React App. You can learn more about Create React App via the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
